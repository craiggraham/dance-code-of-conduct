# Social Guidelines

The goal of this code of conduct is to provide guidelines for an inclusive & welcoming community. We
would like everyone in the Zouk scene to have a relaxed and enjoyable time in classes & in socials.
Keeping to these guidelines will help with that.

If you feel someone is failing to follow these rules & suggestions then please talk to a teacher and we will deal with it.

For our hard rules on behaviour involving any kind of harassment please see our [code of
conduct](https://github.com/michaeljones/dance-code-of-conduct/blob/master/Code.md).


## Unsolicited dance advice & teaching

Social dances are about having fun, relaxing and enjoying the night. It is important not to
criticise, or to offer feedback or advice on the dance floor unless the other person explicitly asks
you for it. Even then do your best to exercise kindness, consideration and an awareness of your own
limits & faults. If you have any doubts at all, direct them to a teacher. It takes more work to fix 
something wrongly learned than to get it right at the beginning.

You might personally feel that you would welcome feedback, but for many people this can be hurtful,
distressing or annoying and it can ruin their mood and their night. It goes against our goals of
building an inclusive community where all feel welcome.

This also applies to classes where unsolicited teaching can disrupt the flow of the class, make it
hard for other students to hear the teacher speak and can include incorrect information.

The only reasonable exception is where you are concerned that your partner's actions might hurt you
in which case you should stop dancing with them. In that situation you can give them polite but
clear feedback about your concerns or talk to a teacher or organiser about the situation.


## Asking & accepting requests for dances

It is completely acceptable to turn down a dance for any reason. Please be polite but do not feel
obliged to dance because someone has asked. 'No, thank you' is a suitably polite response. If
someone does say 'no', please do not repeatedly ask them again through the session. Allow them to
ask you for a dance when they are ready.

This still applies when there is an imbalance between the number of leaders & followers. If there
are very few followers or leaders, they do not have a responsibility to dance more in order to make
up the imbalance. We all deserve to be allowed to rest or to refuse a dance.

It can be hard to be turned down when asking for a dance, but please bear in mind that our community
will be a happier place if everyone feels that they can dance when they want to rather than feeling
obligated to dance every time they are asked. 

That said, please try to dance with everyone if you can. Particularly with beginners, who might be
shy or nervous.


## Personal hygiene

Dancing involves being in close proximity to other people. Odour can be unpleasant and difficult to 
discuss, especially when people do not know each other well. It is important to take care with your
personal hygiene. You should shower before the event and wear freshly washed clothes. You should
have cleaned your teeth and use mints to avoid bad breath.

It is respectful to wear deodorant but not to wear heavy cologne or perfume which can be
overwhelming for your partner.


## Dating & Pick up lines

Social dancing is a great way to meet new people, however we come to enjoy the dance, not to be hit
on. When we try something new like dancing it is often outside of our comfort zone and a little bit
scary. It takes time to get used to and a bit of courage to keep coming back. If we also have to
deal with strangers hitting on us and potentially making us feel uncomfortable then it makes the
situation worse. 

Of course, if you see someone regularly at dancing and feel like you’re building up a genuine
connection with them, then please feel free to ask them for coffee. But be respectful of their
response.


## Adjusting to your Partner's Level

In general, whether leading or following, we should make no assumptions about our partner. When we dance 
with someone we do not know, we should begin by simply and gently exploring what our partner can do. When 
we find something that doesn't work, leave it and try something else. If we find something that only works 
gently and at low speed, keep it gentle and slow. Trying to do too much can be confusing, intimidating, 
unpleasant and even dangerous for someone who is at an earlier stage in the dance.

As a leader for example, do not lead potentially dangerous head movements and cambrés with a beginner. Or
perhaps lead them slowly and clearly for someone who has a little experience but is still
learning.

As a follower, be careful with personal styling that might cause confusion to someone who is not used to it,
and when deliberately initiating situations that might require the leader to confidently adjust to your 
movements.


## Respecting Other People’s Boundaries

Two people who are comfortable with each other can dance Zouk in a very close embrace. However it is
important to keep in mind that we all have different limits on what we find comfortable, and these limits 
will be different when dancing with different people. In any dance situation, we should respect the personal 
space of our partner and so if one person is comfortable in the close embrace, but the other isn’t, we would 
not dance in the close embrace.

As a general rule, always approach your first dances with new people/dancers using an open position,
and movements that allow plenty of personal space.

If moves you want to do require you to be close to your partner, and your partner does not want to be close,
you simply have to select other moves!

## Partner Safety

Dancing risks injury. We all have a responsibility to ourselves and others to minimise that risk.

For leaders this means avoiding positions where your partner is not comfortable. In particular a
leader should pay special attention to not over bending or stressing their partner's back & spine.
The leader should always be responsible for their own weight and should not be in a position where
they are leaning over their partner in a way that distributes the leader's weight on to the partner.
This is particularly important during the 'back' position in head movements.

The lead should never be rough. If the follower does not follow a move, always adapt the
movement rather than adding more force. The lead should be light; it should only be 'firm' enough
to be clear but no firmer. Using more force than necessary can make the dance uncomfortable and
unsafe for your partner, particularly for beginners who are less likely to be able to adapt and keep
up. Forcing followers through moves also means they do not learn to follow correctly.

The follower should take responsibility for their own weight. This means that during cambres and
dips the follower should support their own weight as much as they possibly can. If the leader leads
the follower out of their balance then the follower cannot fully support their own weight.  However
the follower should try to keep their muscles engaged as that reduces the effort required by the
leader and helps to protect the follower.

The follower should not initiate any cambres, dips, drops or any motion that requires the leader to
support them as the leader must be prepared for such movements and if they happen unexpectedly they
can damage the leader's back.

Movements should be smooth and controlled, and hands should not be gripped either by the lead or the
follow. Shoulders especially are very vulnerable to injury by sudden movements, and it is far better 
to lose connection briefly if an arm doesn't easily go where you think it should than to cause or 
experience injury. 


## Dance Floor Awareness

Both social & class dance floors can vary a lot in terms of the amount of space that is available.
At smaller venues and busier events we have to adjust the way that we dance to accommodate the
conditions. It is important for both leaders and followers to be aware of the dancers around them
and to avoid bumps & collisions. The moves, energy and styling that dancers use should be chosen to 
fit the available space so everyone is safe.

Try to be respectful the atmosphere and the other couples on the dance floor. Other dancers might
give you more space if you are dancing big moves but it is rude to use that to claim more than your
fair share of the floor.

## Lifts

We often see various partner lifts performed as part of shows & demonstrations and they are
sometimes taught in classes & workshops. On a busy social dance floor, with a partner you do not know
well, do not use lifts. Your partner might not be expecting them and might be unsure & uncomfortable 
with the motion. As lifts are uncommon movements it is harder for you and the couples around you to avoid
collisions which makes them more dangerous. They should only be attempted by people who know they can get 
them wrong safely, with partners who are familiar with them, and where there is enough space around for 
them to go wrong without collision.

## Clothing

There isn't a general dress code for dancing Zouk. You should wear what you are comfortable with.
That said, you should avoid wearing things that might get caught during a dance. This means that you
should avoid wearing necklaces, bracelets and watches. Long ear rings can potentially get caught and torn 
out. It is also better for leaders to avoid wearing button-up shirts as the follower's hair can be tangled 
in the buttons.

Due to the position of the close embrace it is also standard for leaders to empty their front-right
pockets whilst dancing. Other pockets are fine to use.
